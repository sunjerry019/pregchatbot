The baby learns to recognize and respond to different stimuli, which may encourage physical, mental, and sensory development. Some studies have revealed that stimulated babies exhibit enhanced hearing, linguistic, and motor development. In general, they sleep better, are more alert, confident and content than infants who were not stimulated. They also show superior learning capacity and calm down more easily when they hear familiar sounds they heard while in the womb. Stimulated babies and their families showed more intense bonding and greater family cohesion.

Do I need an episiotomy?,"New mothers in their first pregnancy tend to need an episiotomy more than mothers in their second or subsequent pregnancies. This is because the perineum is less elastic and thus, less able to stretch to accommodate the delivering head. In the past, there has been a belief that routine episiotomies can prevent incontinence, protect the pelvic floor and reduce trauma to the delivering head. However, this theory is yet to be conclusively proven and women delivered without episiotomies seem to do as well as those with episiotomies performed. As such, it is no longer a routine practice.",do,Episiotomy
Why do I still feel pain 2-3 days after episiotomy?,"In most instances, the after pain from an episiotomy lasts only 2�3 days. This is usually mild and can be effectively relieved by either topical anesthetic cream or oral painkillers. If the episiotomy is more extensive, the pain can be managed with intermittent icing through the help of a physiotherapist. Sitting devices shaped as doughnuts may be used to relieve the pressure on your wound.",why,Episiotomy
How to clean episiotomy?,"The aftercare of an episiotomy is essentially a matter of cleanliness. Daily washing with water and frequent changing of soiled sanitary napkins will help keep the wound clean. Dissolvable sutures are used to repair the episiotomy or tear. These stitches do not need to be removed as they will dissolve within two weeks after the wound has healed. You just need to keep the sutures as clean and dry as possible. As the area is richly supplied by blood vessels, the wound can usually heal quite well. Passing of urine or stools will not affect the episiotomy. In fact, you are encouraged to ambulate and walk around.",how,Episiotomy
What is the fastest way to relieve labour pain?,Epidural analgesia (EA) is one of the most reliable and effective ways to relieve labor pain.

Instead of testing around the estimated date of ovulation, you will need to test your urine everyday from day one of your period. It also detects the luteinizing hormone surge (LH surge) that occurs prior to ovulation. The benefit is that instead of a ""yes/no"" answer in the ovulation prediction kit, you will be given information on whether fertility status (low, high, or peak) on a daily basis so you plan your intercourse with more information. The downside is that it is a more expensive and time consuming process. ",what,

The cause of this condition is not clearly understood, but some studies suggest that it can caused by challenges in the maternal hormonal environment (e.g. low progesterone) or even stress.",what,
What is missed miscarriage?,"Missed miscarriage is diagnosed when the cervix is closed, and ultrasound shows that although the fetus remains inside the womb, the fetal heart beat has stopped. The majority of the cases are due to intrisic abnormalities in the fetus itself, such as chromosomal defects. Few cases are due to infections or toxins in early pregnancy  A surgical procedure called dilation and curretage may be needed to clean out the womb. ",what,
What is inevitable miscarriage?,"Inevitable miscarriage is diagnosed when there is vaginal bleeding accompanied by dilation of the cervix, while an early fetus may still remain in the womb. In this case, miscarriage is inevitable because a dilated cervix is not likely to close and keep the fetus safe inside the womb, and the fetus is not able to survive environment outside of the womb until at least 24 weeks gestation. Inevitable miscarriage can be due to fetal abnormalities or maternal anatomical problems. Speak to your doctor when planning another pregancy.",what,
What is partial miscarriage?,"Partial miscarriage is diagnosed when there is vaginal bleeding with partial passing of products of conception (e.g. part of placenta, fetus). The majority of the cases are due to intrisic abnormalities in the fetus itself, such as chromosomal defects. Few cases are due to infections or toxins in early pregnancy. A surgical procedure called dilation and curretage may be needed to clean out the womb. ",what,
What is complete miscarriage?,"Complete miscarriage is diagnosed when there is vaginal bleeding with complete passing out of any products of conception (e.g. entire placenta, fetus). The majority of the cases are due to intrisic abnormalities in the fetus itself, such as chromosomal defects. Few cases are due to infections or toxins in early pregnancy. Unlike partial miscarriage or missed miscarriage, a procedure to clear the womb may not be needed if there is ultrasound evidence that all products of conceptions have been passed out.  ",what,
What are the chances of miscarriage?,"As the rate of miscarriage in the general population is as high as 1 in ever 5 pregnancies, having more than one miscarriage, interspersed by healthy successful pregnancies, may be due to chance. However, true recurrent miscarriages (defined by 3 or more consecutive miscarriages) are concerning for genetic abnormalities or maternal illness, such as autoimmune conditions. Please speak to your doctor to see if rheumatological or genetic tests are suitable for you. ",what,
Can progesterone pills prevent miscarriage?,"The management of threatened miscarriage is still under debate and research. There is no clear evidence showing that progesterone pills can prevent a miscarriage, especially when maternal progesterone levels are already in the normal range (in these cases, the threatened miscarriage is not due to lack of progesterone, so supplementation are unlikely to help). Therefore, the usage of progesterone depends on the country and your doctor. In some institutions, a progesterone blood test is available, and progesterone supplementation is only given if levels are below normal. In any case, progesterone supplementation has little side effects. Please note that progesterone may be used for different purposes in the pregnancy, such a luteal phase support in an IVF pregnancy.",should,
What should I do after I have been diagnosed with threatened miscarriage?,"Bedrest may be beneficial if you're diagnosed with threatened miscarriage, but be sure to prevent other pregnancy complications, such as deep vein thrombosis (bloodclot in the leg veins due to immobility), but purchasing a pair compression stocking.

Please discuss with your doctor pertaining to your unique case!",will,
Is vaginal birth or C-section better for subsequent labour?,"If you have had a vaginal birth before, it is likely that you will experience a quicker and easier labor and delivery this time around. Your perineal muscles and cervix are now familiar with relaxing to allow the baby to exit, which accounts for the shorter birth process. If you have had 1 c-section before, you may discuss with your physician to see if you are a safe candidate for VBAC (vaginal birth after caesarian) if you would like to opt for natural birth.

Studies show that the quality of the breastmilk remains safe and largely unchanged during pregnancy, and pregnancy hormones generally do not pass into the breastmilk.",will,
Will my womb contract due to breastfeeding?,"It is a common concern that breastfeeding may lead to early womb contractions through the hormone, oxytocin. However, during the majority of a normal, uncomplicated pregnancy, breastfeeding only brings on mild womb contractions that does not harm the baby.

There will be an increased risk of the following complications: gestational diabetes, hypertension of pregnancy, miscarriages, preterm labor, stillbirth and certain types of birth defects. Also, it may be more difficult to estimate the baby's size and anatomical features in mums who are overweight. Both normal delivery and caesarian sections may be more difficult and longer in duration for overweight mums as well. You can minimize your risk by staying within the recommended weight range, and working closely with your doctor to monitor any potential complications. Also, as always, try to eliminate all other habits that are bad for your pregnancy, such as drinking and smoking. ",symptom,

Your risk can be minimized by eating well, taking your vitamins, and gaining weight according to the recommned weight range.",symptom,
Will my age cause higher chances of my child getting Down Syndrome?,"Usually, women over 35 years are considered as ""advanced maternal age"" (AMA). Women below 35 years old are generally considered to have low-risk for age-related genetic diseases, such as Down syndrome. For example, the risk of Down Syndrome is 1 in 1250 in a 25 year old mum, 1 in 1000 in a 30 year old mum, but jumps to 1 in 300 for 35 year old mums and 1 in 35 in 45 year old mums. Nevertheless, Down Syndrome screening is now universally recommended to all age groups, because even younger mums still have a small risk of having a baby with Down Syndrome. The good news is, most older mums still give birth to healthy babies! However, as your age increases, the likelihood of having a baby with genetic syndromes, such as Down Syndrome, increases. For example, the risk of Down Syndrome is 1 in 1250 in a 25 year old mum, 1 in 1000 in a 30 year old mum, but jumps to 1 in 300 for 35 year old mums and 1 in 35 in 45 year old mums. We would strongly recommned getting a screening test in the first trimester to determine your baby's risk, if you think this will change your plans for the pregnancy. Other risks include higher chance of miscarriage, preeclampsia, diabetes, and conceiving twins. There is also a higher rate of c-sections among older mums.",symptom,
Will my husband's age affect my baby?,"The older the partner's spermatocytes, the longer they have to undergo mutations or be exposed to environmental harm. For example, the risk of having a miscarriage increases as the dad's age increases. Nevertheless, the effect of dad's age on pregnancy is very small in this age group. In addition to increased risk of miscarriage for dads in this age group, some studies have shown an increase in the risk of autism in fathers older than 40. Nevertheless, the risk is very small.

That�s because infection in pregnancy by the HIV virus, which causes AIDS, is a threat not just to the expectant mom but also to the babyl. Twenty-five percent of babies born to untreated mothers will have the virus. Fortunately, the treatments that are now available reduces this risk greatly. Treating an HIV-positive pregnant woman with antiretroviral drugs can dramatically reduce the risk of her passing the infection on to her baby, without any harmful side effects. For women with a high amount of HIV in their body, delivering by elective c-section (before contractions begin and before membranes rupture) can reduce the risk of transmission even more.

After delivery, the right precautions can allow you to care for and breastfeed your baby without passing along the virus, even during an active infection. A herpes infection that appears for the first time in pregnancy increases the risk of miscarriage and premature delivery. If you haven�t had genital herpes before, and is now showing any signs of a primary infection (fever, headache, fatigue, and achiness for 2 or more days, accompanied by genital pain, itching, pain when urinating, vaginal and urethral discharge, and tenderness in the groin, as well as lesions that blister and then crust over), call your doctor immediately.

That�s because the risks of x-rays during pregnancy are really very low and can be easily made even lower. Dental x-rays target your mouth. In addition, your doctor will put a lead shield to protect your baby.. What�s more, a typical diagnostic x-ray of any kind rarely delivers more radiation than you�d get from spending a few days in the sun at the beach. Harm to a fetus occurs only at very high doses, doses you�re extremely unlikely to ever be exposed to. Still, if you do need an x-ray during pregnancy, keep the following rules in mind. The x-ray equipment should, when possible, be directed so that only the minimum area necessary is exposed to radiation. A lead apron will be used to shield your womb, and a thyroid collar should protect your neck. ",should,

It is a non-invasive test that enjoys high sensitivity of 99% (i.e. very likely to pick up almost all Down Syndrome cases), compared to 90% sensitivity in the First Trimester Test. Keep in mind that it is a screening test, not a diagnostic test. Some mothers feel adequately confident by the result a 99% sensitive screening test, while others prefer to go for a definite diagnostic test - namely amiocentesis or chorionic vili sampling (CVS). Click the link to find out more.",what,
What is a Chorionic Vilic Sampling (CSV) test?,"If you receive a high-risk Down Syndrome screening test, we would recommend that you go for a diagnostic test. Since you are currently before 13 weeks gestation, the most appropriate diagnostic test is chorionic vilic sampling. Cells from tiny fingerlike projections on your placenta called the chorionic villi are taken and sends them to a lab for genetic analysis. This procedure is only done by obstetric specialists.",what,
What is an Amniocentesis test?,"If you receive a high-risk Down Syndrome screening test, we would recommend that you go for a diagnostic test. Since you are currently at or after your 13 weeks of gestation, the most appropriate diagnostic test is amniocentesis. A small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus, and then the fetal DNA is examined for genetic abnormalities. This procedure is only done by obstetric specialists.",what,
What are the different types of scans during pregnancy?,"There are 4 scans offered during pregnancy: 1) Dating Scan, 2) OSCAR test, 3) Fetal Abnormalities Scan, 4) Growth Scan",what,
What is the dating scan?,"The dating scan is usually done around 8-10 weeks after your last menstural period (i.e. 4-6 weeks after your missed period). It is used to confirm the place of the fetus inside the womb and the presence of a heart beat, which indicates viability. The size of the fetus is measured and used to estimate the current gestational age of the baby, as well as your estimated date of delivery. This scan will also be able to tell you if you're having one baby or more than one. How exciting!",what,
What is the OSCAR test?,"The OSCAR test, recommended around 12 weeks, is used to screen for fetal trisomies - an abnormalities of the genetic composition of the baby. The risk of your baby having trisomy is calculated based on an algorithm, taking into consideration measuresments of the fetal neck, nosebone, and maternal age. In the case of a high risk result (greater than 1 in 100 chance), further testing is neccesary to confirm the diagnosis.",what,
What is the Fetal Abnomalities scan?,"The Fetal Abnormalities scan is recommended at 20 weeks gestional. This is an important ultrasound scan that takes a detailed look at all the major organs of the baby and whether they are developing normally. This includes four chambers of the heart, the brain, the limbs, and the abdominal organs. Usually, this is also the time to find out the gender of the baby, if you wish to do so!",what,
What is growth scan?,"Growth scans are ultrasounds done routinely starting in the third trimester. Their main purpose is to check the position of the placenta and position of the baby (head up or down) in order to plan the delivery. Additionally, the fetal weight is estimated by taking the abdominal circumference of the fetus on the scan.",what,
How can I deal with forgetfulness?,"Feeling stressed about this intellectual fogginess will only make it worse (stress also compounds forgetfulness). Recognizing that it is normal (and not imagined), even accepting it with a sense of humor, may help to ease it�or, at least, make you feel better about it. Realistically, it might just not be possible to be as efficient as you were before you took on the added job of baby making. Keeping checklists on your smartphone (along with reminder alarms) can help contain the mental chaos�that is, if you can remember where you put your phone last. Set electronic reminders of important dates and appointments, and tap into the What to Expect app. Strategically placed post-its (one on the front door to remind you to take your keys, for instance) can also help keep you on track.
 ",how,
What kind of diet should I take to deal with forgetfulness?,You may find more focus from incorporating protein and complex carbohydrates. Low blood sugar caused skipping meals can definitely contribute to that foggy feeling.,what,
Should I eat Ginkgo Biloba to improve my memory?,"Although ginkgo biloba has been touted for its memory-boosting properties, it�s not considered safe for use during pregnancy. We would advice staying away from any herbal preparation which are advertised in this manner, as they are adequately rarely tested for safetly.",should,
Can I whiten by teeth during pregnancy?,"While there are no proven risks to tooth whitening during pregnancy, it is probably worthwhile to delay until after the pregnancy like most elective procedures involving chemicals, just to be on the super safe side. Be sure to keep your teeth clean and well flossed, as gums are extra sensitive during pregnancy.",should,
Is Yoga good for my pregenancy?,"Yoga encourages relaxation, focus, and paying attention to your breathing�so it�s just about perfect for pregnancy, childbirth, and even parenting. It also increases oxygenation (bringing more oxygen to the baby) and increases flexibility, possibly making pregnancy�and delivery�easier. Be sure to select a class that�s specifically tailored to expecting mothers or ask your instructor how to modify poses so that they�re safe for you. Some points to look out for: refrain from being on your back for too long after the 4th month, avoid full inversions (handstand, supported shoulder stand, and supported headstand), as your balance may off, and it my cause potential sudden changes in blood pressure which could cause dizziness and falls. Another important caveat: Avoid Bikram or hot yoga. It�s done in a very warm room (one that�s generally 90�F to 100�F), and you�ll need to take a pass during pregnancy on any workouts that heat you up too much.
",symptom,
Can I do Bikram or hot yoga?,"Please avoid Bikram or hot yoga during the pregnancy. Being in a very warm room (one that�s generally 90�F to 100�F) elevates your body temperature, and this is harmful for the baby's brain and body development. For the same reason, skip the sauna, steam room, and onsen for the time being. Short warm showers are usually fine!",should,
Why do I feel more sweaty and hot during pregnancy?,"Yes indeed it is normal to feel damp and sweating in the pregnancy. As with many symptoms in pregnancy, feeling sweating in pregnancy is due to hormonal changes as well as increased blood flow to the skin. Here are are some ways to stay comfortable and cool down: 1) Wear loose, light clothing in cotton or other breathable fabrics, and dress in layers rather than one item of thick clothing so you adjust easily as you heat up. 2) When sleeping, besides turning the temperature down, switch your sleepwear, pillow and cover to natural fibers. 3) Eating lightly more frequently will require less effort to digest. Choose frozen fruits as snacks such as frozen grapes, mangoes, banana. Not only will you net some vitamin C and K, this delicious chilled snack will help cool you down (and it�s a whole lot lower in fat than ice cream). Not a grape lover? You can freeze any type of cut up fruit (think mango, banana, berries, and so on) and grab it when you�re heating up. 4) Freeze your water bottle and sipping the icy water as it melts. 5) Take a cool shower or wet your hands with cold water and then run your fingers through your hair. A cooler head will prevail in cooling down your body. 6) Put any moisturising lotion in the fridge for at least 30 minutes before you apply. When you rub the cold creams on your skin, it�ll help cool you down. keep a bottle of facial mist in the fridge (at home and on the job) for a cold spritz. 7) Try putting ice packs, cold compresses, or cold running water on your inner wrists, neck, ankles, and behind the knees. Since these are pulse points, the cold temp on the outside will help cool the blood inside.",why,
Can I use steroids during pregnancy?,"Most steroids are category ""C"" drugs for use in pregnancy which means that evidence is not clear. Reactional use should be suspended, while if it is used for a medical reason, you should discuss with your doctor about the risk-benefit ratio. If stopping steroids may cause serious harm to the mother (e.g. with asthma or rheumatoid arthritis), doctors may advice you to continue to steroids. For relief from a stuffy nose, most steroid-containing nasal sprays are fine to use.  Small amounts of topi- cal hydrocortisones (such as Cortaid) are safe during pregnancy. Use sparingly on rashes or bug bites when necessary.",should,
Can I take Panadol during pregnancy?,"Paracetamol is a category ""B"" drug and one of the safest medication to take in pregnancy. It is the preferred choice to treat mild or moderate pain and fever. However, before taking any medicine when you're pregnant, you should get advice from your family physician or obstetrician. Another class of pain killers called nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAID), such as Naproxen or Ibuprofen, are not recommended for use in pregnancy.",should,
Can I take anti-inflammation drugs during pregnancy?,Nonsteroidal anti- inflammatory drugs (NSAID) are not recommended for use in pregnancy. Please speak to your doctor about your other options for pain relieve or anti-inflammation.,should,
What is progesterone?,"Progesterone is a female hormone that plays an integral role in maintaining the uterine lining so an embryo can implant and grow. The corpus luteum, the leftover remnant of the follicle that produced an egg that month, produces progesterone starting immediately after ovulation. If an embryo implants,the placenta gradually takes over progesterone production around 10 weeks into pregnancy as the corpus luteum disintegrates. Some women have may have low progesterone levels early in pregnancy, and a shot or pills of progesterone may be prescribed to support the pregnancy, especially in the case of in-vitro fetilization. Low progesterone has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of miscarriage",what,
"I have blood in my stools, is this normal during pregnancy?","Blood in the stools in pregnancy is most commonly due to hemorrhoids or piles. More than half of all expectant moms develop hemorrhoids, which is when veins in the lower intestine become swollen due to pressure from your enlarging womb, plus increased blood flow to the pelvic area. Hemorrhoids can sometimes bleed, especially when you�re bearing down during a bowel movement, though anal fissures (painful cracks in the skin of the anus caused by straining from constipation) can also be the cause of rectal bleeding. Hemorrhoids are not dangerous, just uncomfortable. They usually go away sometime after delivery�though they can occasionally be aggravated or even develop for the first time postpartum as a result of pushing during childbirth. However, to rule out any less likely cause of rectal bleeding (e.g. colorectal cancer, which are rare in the reproductive age group but still possible especially in those with a positive family history), check in with your practitioner about any rectal bleeding.",symptom,
"I have diabetes, what should I do during pregnancy?","If you already have diabetes going into the pregnancy, whether it is Type 1 (in which the body doesn�t produce insulin) or Type 2 (in which the body doesn�t respond as it should to insulin), it is key to maintain normal blood glucose levels before conception and maintaining them throughout the 9 months after it. You�ll be able to do that with a carefully designed diet (it will probably be similar to the Pregnancy Diet, but containing few sugary sweets and refined grains and plenty of fiber-rich food and healthy snacks), regular exercise, careful monitoring of your blood sugar, and the right medication (insulin, if necessary). You also will be given a pregnancy weight-gain goal, which will be especially important to stick to since gaining too much weight can put you at risk of pregnancy complications. To make sure all is going well, you�ll be watched carefully during pregnancy. Along with regular tests for blood sugar levels you�ll also have urine tests (to check kidney function) and eye exams (to check your retinas), and your baby will be checked with a fetal echocardiogram (to make sure his or her heart is developing without problems).",what,
Can I breastfeed even if I have diabetes?,"If you�re planning to breast-feed, try to get started as soon as possible after birth (ideally within 30 minutes) and feed every 2 to 3 hours to prevent hypoglycemia (low blood sugar). To play it safe, babies of diabetic moms are usually not discharged from the hospital until they are maintaining blood glucose levels and feeding well.",should,
How should my diet be if I am diabetic and pregnant?,"If you already have diabetes going into the pregnancy, whether it is Type 1 (in which the body doesn�t produce insulin) or Type 2 (in which the body doesn�t respond as it should to insulin), it is key to maintain normal blood glucose levels before conception and maintaining them throughout the 9 months after it.

Can I use aromatherapy during pregnancy?,"We would advice expecting mums to approach aromatherapy with caution, as the effects of many plant oils in pregnancy are unknown and some may be harmful. The following essential oils are considered safe for prenatal massage, though experts recommend that they be mixed at a concentration that�shalf the standard usage or lower: rose, lavender, chamomile, jasmine, tangerine, neroli, and ylang-ylang. Pregnant women should particularly avoid the following oils, because some of them can trigger uterine contractions: basil, juniper, rosemary, sage, peppermint, pennyroyal, oregano, and thyme. If you have already had an aromatherapy massage with these oils, don�t worry. The absorption of the oil is very low, especially because the skin on your back is pretty thick. Just steer clear of them in future treatments. Scented lotions or beauty products sold at bath and beauty shops are fine since the chemicals are usually dilute.",should,
Can I travel to high altitude areas?,"If it is not a must, we would recommend avoiding travelling to locations with a high altitute. This is because the air is thinner in high altitute regions (meaning that oxygen concentration is lower), which can exacerbate breathlessness. Breathlessness in pregnancy is even more common towards the end of pregnancy, when the enlarged womb presses upward to reduce lung space.",should,
"I just got pregnant, when can I feel my baby move?","If you are less than 18 weeks into your pregnancy, your baby is too small for you to feel kicks! By the 18th to the 20th week, you will be more aware of your baby moving inside your womb.",when,
"I have been pregnant for a while, how often should I feel my baby move?","At this time in your pregnancy, you should be feeling your child move around. If you are beyond 28 weeks, test your babies movement by starting a timer and counting the number of baby movements. If you have less than 10 by the end of an hour, have a snack, walk around or lie down, then continue counting. If you have less than 10 movements in 2 hours, it is advised you consult your doctor for further evaluation.",how,
Why is one leg more swollen than the other?,It is advised that you check with your doctor as soon as possible.

When should I do HIV screening?,"Great question! All women are recommended HIV screening as early as possible during each pregnancy unless they choose to decline. This is important as 25% of babies born to untreated mothers will develop the HIV infection. If a mother is HIV positive, she will be treated with antiretroviral drugs during her pregnancy to reduce the risk of her passing the infection to her baby, without any harmful side effects. Throughout her pregnancy, the levels of the HIV virus will be monitored. If they are high, her doctor might recommend a c-section to further reduce the risk of passing it to her baby.

What is hCG?,"hCG stands for human chorionic gonadotropin - it is the pregnancy hormone and is produced by the newly developing placenta after the fertilized egg implants in your womb. This hormone is present in your blood and urine and is detected by the home pregnancy test kit. The hormones increase rapidly during the first trimester, but don't be too worried about the actual numbers as they can vary. After the 5th or 6th week of pregnancy, the ultrasound scan is more predictive of pregnancy outcome than the hCG level. If you have any questions about your hCG levels, talk to your doctor.",what,

What are eyelash extensions and can I use eyelash extensions?,"Eyelash extension is a popular way to enhance the length, curliness, fullness, and thickness of natural eyelashes. The extensions may be made from several materials including mink, synthetic, or human hair. The main method of applying the extensions on is by using an adhesive glue to individually sticking them to the eyelashes one-by-one, and this is to prevent the eyelashes from sticking together. The skin on the eyelids is very thin and chemicals could be absorbed and affect your baby, and the safety of the glue has not been studied in pregnancy. Some argue that as long as the person is certified, uses sensitive glue and applies the lashes properly, attaching them to your lashes and not the skin, it should not cause any harm to you or your baby. However, some trained professionals may not recommend this as the expecting mother has to lie on her back for up to 2 hours for the application.

There is a broad range of when the first detection of movement can be felt, ranging from 16-24 weeks. Some women describe it as a light tapping, or the fluttering of a butterfly. Remember that each woman and every pregnancy is different, so you may not feel movement as early as another woman! If you are less than 18 weeks into your pregnancy, your baby may be too small for you to feel kicks! By the 18th to the 20th week, you will be more aware of your baby moving inside your womb. During this period, many expecting mothers start to feel their baby moving. First time mothers may not know for sure if what they're feeling is really a baby, whereas experienced moms tend to notice sooner. The movements felt can range from light fluttering to hiccups (which feels like popcorn popping) and even kicking!",what,
Should I count my baby's movements?,"Beyond 28 weeks, it is beneficial to count your babies movements. This will help you to identify potential problems and can also be a great bonding experience between you and your baby. Using a kick count chart  or simply start the timer and count the movements!

There is no rules or regulations on how many visitors you're allowed to have, so your newborn may be welcomed into the world in a more natural and flexible setting. The major downside of having a homebirth is that you will not be close to hospital facilities and personnel in the case of any emergencies in the birthing process, such as those requiring immediate surgery. Studies have shown that there is an increased risk of adverse events to the baby in a home birth. For this reason, we would not recommend homebirths for pregnancies that are complicated, or have an increased risk of requiring surgery (e.g. high predicted birthweight).",should,

What is a normal size new born?,"For a full-term baby (born at 37 weeks gestation or later), the normal weight is between 2.5kg and 4.0kg. This is not synonymous with ""appropriate for gestational age"", which is the average weight compared to a baby who was born at the same gestational age. For example, a premature baby born at 35-week gestational age and weights 2250g is appropriate for his or her gestational age, but is still considered low birth weight as he or she weighs less than 2.5kg.",what,
When is the latest I can fly on an airplane in the pregnancy? ,"Generally, most international flight allows pregnant women up to 34 weeks gestations to board the flight. Of course, this would depend on your unique situation (e.g. women with signs of preterm labour should not be flying even before 34 weeks), and sometimes requires a letter from your medical practitioner.

"I'm having lower back pain, what can I do?","Postpartum backache is a common symptom experienced by many women. It is due to the ligaments and muscles that we're stretched during your pregnancy. Now that you have a little one with you, the carrying, feeding, and rocking could also put a strain on your back. As your baby bump grows, your lower back curves to accomodate the increasing weight in the front, causing the strained muscles and pain experienced. Here are some tips to relieve the pain: 1) Relief your back ache (and your arms) with a sling or a wrap! Not only does this reduce the ache from carrying your baby, it will be soothing for the baby and you. 2) Book a massage, get a heating pad. 3) Strengthen your muscles.",what,

Should I plan a birth plan?,"That's a great question! With so many options during pregnancy, a birth plan is designed to help expecting couples lay out their preferences and have a smooth and informed decision making process during pregnancy and labour. Some birth plans cover the basics while others are extremely detailed. Discuss with your doctor to find out more about a birth plan and if you would like one.",should,
How do I reduce labour pain?,"Unfortunately, there is no pain like labour pain. But fret not, there are many different ways to get through the pain of labour! These options include techniques on breathing, relaxation, distraction and visualisation exercises. Even if you are on medications to control your pain, combine them with these methods for added effect! Nitrious oxide (also known as the laughing gas) is not the strongest pain reliever but can help to ease the pain from contractions. It is self-administered during labour, and you can choose to use it when necessary. Not all hospitals offer it, so check with your doctor if you are considering using it. This is one of the most common labour pain medications, as it is safe during pregnancy, easy to administer, and effective. After your back is cleaned with antiseptic and numbed with local anaesthesia, a needle is placed through the area into the epidural space. The needle is then removed, leaving a small flexible catheter tube in its place where the pain relief medication is introduced. Not all women will be able to receive an epidural due to other medical issues so check with your doctor if this is an option for you.",how,
How do I differentiate between true and false labour?,"Early contractions experienced during true labour feel like heavy menstrual cramps. They become progressively more frequent (but not necessarily more regular) and painful and the intensity builds up as labour progresses. This is not relieved with a change in position, activity or rest. If you think you are in real labour, consult your doctor for further evaluation. Real labour probably has not begun if the contractions are not regular or do not increase in frequency or severity, or if they are intermittent. False contractions subside if you walk around or change your position. Braxton Hicks contractions, which are also false labour, are the tightening of the uterine muscles thought to help the body in its preparation for childbirth. ",how,
How can I relieve the discomfort from the Braxton Hicks contractions?,"Drink more water to stay adequately hydrated as dehydration can make muscles spasm, thus bringing on a Braxton Hicks contraction. Try changing your position, lie down or walk around. A full bladder can sometimes trigger Braxton Hicks, so urination may end the contractions. Early contractions experienced during true labour feel like heavy menstrual cramps.

Should I have vaginal birth after caesarean?,"Vaginal birth after caesarean (VBAC) is a safe and appropriate choice for most women who have had a prior caesarean delivery. A vaginal birth means a shorter hospital stay, lower risk of infection, and a faster recovery. However, there is a small risk of uterine rupture with VBAC; this risk rises with an increased number of previous caesarean deliveries. Discuss with your doctor about your options of trial of labour or a scheduled caesarean section. ",should,
Can I undergo a C-Section and what are the risks?,"Caesarean section, although considered major surgery, is a safe and common way to deliver a baby. The number of caesarean sections a woman can undergo depends on multiple factors, such as the types of incisions made during the previous surgeries, how they have healed, the scars that form after the procedure and the presence of complications. Every surgical procedure puts you at risk of complications for the next pregnancy, such as uterine rupture, placenta previa (low-lying placenta), and placenta accreta (abnormally attached placenta). While some institutions and doctors do not recommend vaginal birth after 3 previous caesarean sections, there is no official arbitrary limits placed. Discuss with your doctor on the different options of delivery and what would be best suited for you.",what,
Can I schedule a C-section in advance?,"Women may schedule a c-section in advance due to various reasons. This includes: 1) a previous c-section, where VBAC is not an option 2) where the babies head may be too big to fit through the mother's pelvis (known as cephalopelvic disproportion) 3) multiple pregnancies (e.g. twins and triplets) 4) when the baby is not in a position that facilitates vaginal birth (such as breech position) 5) obesity in mothers 6) an active herpes infection which can be transmitted to the baby during a vaginal delivery 7) a low lying placenta (known as placenta previa) which blocks the cervical opening. If you have any of these or are considering an elective c-section, discuss this (and possible alternatives) with your doctor.",should,
What is an emergency C-Section?,"Sometimes during labour, the mother might end up requiring an emergency caesarean section to deliver her baby. There are several reasons for this: 1) labour fails to progress (the cervix might not be dilating, it might be taking too long to push the baby out, assisted delivery with a vacuum extractor or forceps might not be appropriate or did not work) 2) the foetus is in distress 3) the womb has ruptured 4) the umbilical cord has prolapsed and is at risk of being compressed, depriving the baby of oxygen. Rest assured that your doctor and the team taking care of you will always consider yours and your baby's safety as the top priority in determining the appropriate mode of delivery.",what,
Do I need to test for group B strep infection?,"Group B strep (GBS) is a strain of bacteria that lives harmlessly in the vaginas of many healthy women. While they do not affect the mother, they can be transmitted to a baby as he or she passes through the vagina during delivery, causing a potentially serious infection. Before 35 weeks, testing for GBS not accurate in determining who will be carrying GBS at the time of delivery. Unless you have risk factors and have been told that you will be given treatment during labour, remember to request for the GBS test when you are more than 35 weeks into your pregnancy. If you tested positive you will be given IV antibiotics during labour to get rid of the bacteria to eliminate any risk to your baby.  ",do,
Can I drive during pregnancy? ,"As long as you can fit comfortably in the driver's seat, you can still drive.  If you are driving for hours or long distances, remember to take frequent breaks to get up and walk around as being immobile for too long during pregnancy can increase your risk of thromsbosis. If you are in labour, do not drive yourself to the hospital as the pain from contractions may be distracting. Most importantly, always remember to buckle up!",should,
How can I make driving more comfortable?,"Move the seat back and tilt the wheel up to make it more comfortable for you.

I am past my due and worried about labour.,"At this point, you are still going along your pregnancy and cannot predict when it is time to go into labour. Enjoy the remaining period before delivery and let nature take its course!",symptom,
What can I do to make labour easier?,"It has been proposed that the swaying from your hips coupled with the force of gravity from walking can help ease your baby into the pelvis. The baby's pressure on the cervix might get labour going! But even if it doesn't, walking and keeping fit during pregnancy will keep your energized and in great shape. Stimulating your nipples for a few hours each day can release oxytocin, promoting contractions. However, be sure to discuss this with your doctor first as the contractions that come on may be too strong and painful, and your nipples may be sore from the stimulation. Research has shown that semen (which contains prostaglandins) can stimulate contractions and promote labour once a woman has reached term, in addition to the release of oxytocin during orgasm. Even if it doesn't work, take this period to enjoy intimacy with your partner before baby comes and you're both too busy! Raspberry leaf tea and evening primrose may help trigger contractions and promote labour. Before trying any of these, always check with your doctor to make sure that the remedy you are interested in is safe during pregnancy.",what,

If 1) the wet spot smells sweet (unlike urine) 2) you continue leaking the pale, straw-coloured fluid 3) you are able to stop the flow by squeezing your pelvic muscles, chances are that your water has probably broke and you are leaking fluid. Consult your doctor for further medical evaluation.",symptom,
What happens when I have too little amniotic fluid?,"Having too little amniotic fluid is a condition also known as oligohydramnios, which is detected on ultrasound. While most women with oligohydramnios will have a completely normal pregnancy, there is a small risk of umbilical cord constriction if there is not enough fluid for your baby to float around in. Oligohydramnios may result from 1) puncture from amniocentesis procedure 2) a problem with the baby such as poor foetal growth or an abnormal kidney or urinary tract. Discuss with your doctor on treatment options if you have been diagnosed with oligohydramnios.",what,
What happens when I have too much amniotic fluid?,"Having too much amniotic fluid is a condition also known as polyhydramnios, which is detected on ultrasound. Many women with polyhydramnios will have a completely normal pregnancy, but there is a small risk of preterm premature rupture of membranes, preterm labour, placental abruption, breech presentation or umbilical cord prolapse. Polyhydramnios may be due to a problem with the baby, such as a defect in the centra nervous system or gastrointestinal system, or an inability to swallow. Discuss with your doctor on treatment options if you have been diagnosed with polyhydramnios.",what,
What is Labour Induction?,"Labour induction is the process or treatment that stimulates childbirth and delivery. Your cervix first needs to be ripened. This will be done by inserting a device or a vaginal pessary containing a hormonal substance like prostaglandin. You will be checked after a few hours to see if yoru cervix is getting softer and beginning to efface and dilate. If not, the process may be repeated. Once your cervix is ripened, your doctor may artifically rupture your membranes, if they are still intact, to get labour started. If you are still not having regular contractions, your doctor may administer medications to promote contractions. Rest assured that during this process, your baby will be continuously monitored to see how he or she is dealing with the stress of labour. In the case where labour fails to progress or the foetus shows signs of distress, this may be stopped in favour of a caesarean delivery. ",what,
When will I need labour induction?,There are several cases where labour induction is indicated: 1) your membranes have ruptured but your contractions have not started 2) you have a complication (such as pre-eclampsia or gestational diabetes) that makes it risky to continue your pregnancy 3) your womb might no longer be optimal for your baby due to problems with your placenta or amniotic fluid 4) you are overdue and your baby is thriving and mature enough to be delivered. ,when,
What are the different stages of childbirth?,"Childbirth progresses in 3 stages: labour, delivery of the baby, and delivery of the placenta. Stage 1 of childbirth is labour - the longest phase. This consists of the thinning and opening (dilation) of your cervix, as well as contractions. It is your body's way of preparing for the birth of your baby! Remember to monitor and time your contractions to see if you are going into true labour or not. Stage 2 consists of pushing and the delivery of the baby. During this time, the contractions become more frequent and intense. Once you are evaluated and given the green light, start pushing when you feel the urge to. Now would be a good time to start your breathing exercises and try to relax fully in between contractions so that you can conserve energy. Stage 3 consists of delivery of the placenta. Your practitioner will gently but firmly pull the cord of the placenta with one hand, with the other massaging your lower abdomen to contract the womb and help expel the placenta. Once it is out, your practitioner will check to make sure it is full intact. If it is not, he or she will inspect your womb and remove and remaining fragments.",what,
Do I need vacuum extractor or forceps during delivery?,Great question! What you are referring to is an assisted delivery (or sometimes called an operative vaginal delivery). ,do,
Will I need assisted delivery?,"The common reasons why one might need assisted delivery are: - concerns about the baby�s heart rate pattern during labor, -
the baby�s head has stopped moving down the birth canal even after pushing for a long time, - labour has been long and you are tired, - you are unable to push safely and effectively",will,
What are the advantages of assisted delivery?,"There are 2 types: forceps-assisted delivery and vacuum-assisted delivery. The main advantage that it avoids a cesarean delivery and the risks that come with it (such as bleeding, infection, and possible future complications in pregnancy). Also, recovery from a vaginal delivery generally is shorter than recovery from a cesarean delivery. For the mother, assisted deliveries are associated with a small increased risk of injury to the tissues of the vagina, perineum and anus. This can lead to urinary or fecal incontinence in a small number of women, which may resolve on its own or might need treatment. For the baby, there is a small risk of injuries to the baby's scalp, head, eyes, bleeding inside the skull or nerv injury. There are no effects on the child's development, and rest assured the practitioner who performs this is well-trained. ",what,
How is Forceps Assisted Delivery carried out?,Forceps look like two interlocked large spoons. They are inserted into the vagina and cupped around the baby�s head. Gentle traction are applied on the forceps to help guide the baby�s head out of the birth canal while you keep pushing.,how,
How is vacuum assisted delivery carried out?,"A vacuum device is a suction cup with a handle attached. The suction cup is placed in the vagina and applied to the top of the baby�s head. Gentle, well-controlled traction is used to help guide the baby out of the birth canal while you keep pushing.",how,
Is it normal to have a low placenta?,"Great question! A low-lying placenta is one that covers the cervix (also known as the neck of the womb). In early pregnancy, a low-lying placenta is common! Mothers may be concerned that the placenta is blocking the cervix and thus birth passage, making vaginal delivery impossible. Fret not, as you still going through your pregnancy, as your womb gets bigger, it will pull the placenta upwards, therefore no longer blocking your cervix. Your doctor may repeat another ultrasound scan in a few weeks or in the third trimester to confirm if the placenta is still low-lying or has moved up. If you notice any bleeding from below during this time, please see a doctor. If the placenta is still low-lying in the third trimester, it is called placenta previa. It can partially or completely cover the cervix, and requires a discussion with your doctor about a c-section, as vaginal delivery may not be an option in this case. Sometimes this can cause bleeding (usually without any pain). If this happens, please see your doctor.",symptom,
Will my sleeping position affect my pregnancy?,"In the first trimester, your baby is still tiny and your bump hasn't shown. If you normally sleep on your back, it is safe to continue doing so during the first trimester. However, once you reach the second trimester and your baby bump starts to show, it is best to sleep on your left side, as it helps to prevent the pressure from your enlarging womb on the vein that returns blood from your lower body to your heart, and also improves the flow of blood and nutrients to the placenta which helps your baby grow. Not used to sleeping on your left? Try placing pillows behind you to keep you propped on your left side and to stop you rolling on to your back at night. Ease the strain on your hips and back by placing a pillow under your bump and between your knees. As your baby grows and your womb gets heavier, it is best to lie on your side, ideally on your left. The concern with sleeping on your back is that the pressure from your womb on the vein that returns blood from your lower body to your heart. This may cause your blood pressure to drop, leading to you feeling lightheaded. Sleeping in your left side not only helps to prevent this, but also improves the flow of blood and nutrients to the placenta, helping your baby grow.

Can I get a wax during pregnancy?,"During pregnancy, your hormones contributes to the excess growth of hair on parts of your body, such as the armpits, bikini line, upper lip, and even the belly. Some women may choose to remove the hair on their belly so that it will not affect the�healing�of the incision if they had a c-section.�Don't worry, this is not permanent and most of them go away after childbirth. There are plenty of safe and reliable hair removal options, like shaving, plucking, threading and waxing. If you are doing this at a professional salon, let your aesthetician know so that she can be extra gentle, as the skin during pregnancy is sensitive and can be easily irritated. You could also easily do this at home, but again, remember to be gentle on your skin. Other permanent hair removal options are lasers, electrolysis and depilatories. These have not been studied enough to prove their safety in pregnancy, thus some salons might not offer these services to pregnant women. Also, discuss with your doctor first as some might advise against these methods for the first trimester and some might prefer to hold off for the entire 9 months.",should,
What is cord blood banking? ,"This is a great question! Many mothers consider whether their babies umbilical cord blood should be save, and if so, how it is done. Cord blood is special because it contains stem cells that have the capability to turn into any other kind of blood or immune cells in the body - this is useful in treating certain blood diseases or certain immune disorders. It is a safe, short and painless procedure where the blood is harvested from the cord (after it has been clamped and cut). Cord blood donated to a public cord bank will be made available to any patient in need. You could also choose to store your blood at a private cord bank, although this will be more expensive. If you are interested in storing your baby's umbilical cord blood, let your doctor know early to allow time for administrative planning. ",what,
Can my partner cut the cord?,"If you have delivered vaginally, your partner can cut the cord if he feels confident. You can include this in your birth plan or let your doctor know about your preference beforehand. The cord is nearly an inch thick and is very strong, thus do not feel defeated as it might take a few tries with the scissors to complete the job. For C-Section, ss this is a surgical procedure, the sterile field needs to be maintained. The surgeon performing the c-section will cut the umbilical cord after he or she has delivered the baby. If it is a planned elective procedure, your partner can be with you in the operating room to support you by your side. However, if it is an emergency c-section, your partner will not be allowed in and will be asked to wait outside. ",should,
Can I swim during pregnancy?,"Generally, it�s considered safe to swim during pregnancy. Many physicians agree that this is a good way for pregnant women to get a workout, due to the low amount of stress and resistance that it puts on the body. As long as you take precautions and listen to the doctor, your body swimming is a great activity. Any pool you swim in should be chlorinated or be purified, and check ahead about the safety of local lakes, rivers, and oceans you might be swimming in. Be sure to use sunscreen while in the sun and don�t forget to reapply it often. ",should,
What are the benefits of swimming during pregnancy?,"During the first trimester, swimming may help to not only boost your energy level, but may relief morning sickness in some women. Be careful when walking on slippery pool sides, and don't dive in. During the second trimester, your baby bump is starting to show and it might be getting more difficult for your body to engage in strenuous activities. Being in the water creates a feeling of weightlessness, which expectant mothers appreciate. During the third trimester, water workouts can ease leg and feet swelling, and relieve back pain. Being in the water also creates a feeling of weightlessness, which expectant mothers, especially those in late pregnancy, appreciate. Let your body relax, spend sometime floating and enjoy the relief, but be careful when walking on slippery pool sides, and don't dive in.",what,
How to I do a paternity test?,"Determing the father of your baby establishes legal and social benefits, provides an adequate medical history for your child, and can strengthen the bond between father and child. Paternity testing can be done during pregnancy or after the child is born. C",how,
What kind of paternity tests are there?,"There are invasive and non-invasive options for paternity testing during pregnancy: Non-invasive prenatal paternity (NIPP), amniocentesis and chorionic villous sampling. Postnatal testing can be done through an umbilical cord collection at the time of delivery. Alternatively, a sample can collected (either a cheek swab or a blood collection) at a lab after you and your baby are discharged from the hospital. NIPP is the most accurate (99.9%) non-invasive way to establish paternity before the baby is born. It requires only a simple blood collection from the mother and partner and can be performed any time after the 8th week of pregnancy. There are two invasive tests available. If you are currently before 13 weeks into your pregnancy, chorionic vilious sampling would be appropriate for you. Cells from tiny fingerlike projections on your placenta called the chorionic villi are taken and sends them to a lab for genetic paternity analysis. If you are currently at or after your 13 weeks of gestation, amniocentesis would be the appropriate test. A small amount of amniotic fluid, which contains fetal tissues, is sampled from the amniotic sac surrounding a developing fetus, and then the fetal DNA is examined to determine the paternity. These two procedures are only done by obstetric specialists, and have a small risk of miscarriage.",what,
Is it normal to pass motion during labour?,"Passing stool during labour can happen especially if the bowel is full. This is because the bowel lies underneath the womb, and there can be pressure on it when you push. Do not be too worried about this, as the people in the delivery room are there to support you and help you. Try to focus on your baby, not your bowel. Some doctors may offer a fleet enema to clear your bowels before labour, talk to your doctor to see if this is an option for you.",symptom,
What should the partner do during labour,"Continue giving comfort and support (without being overbearing), but don�t be hurt if your efforts go unnoticed, her energies are focused on delivering a baby! Help her relax in between contractions with a cool cloth or a massage. Supply ice chips or sips of water. Help keep her in a comfortable position to push (whether it is holding her hand, leg, or supporting her back).",what,

What is delayed cord clamping?,"Traditionally, the umbilical cord is clamped immediately after delivery as it is thought to reduce postpartum bleeding. However, delaying the clamp for 1-2 mins after delivery gives a few extra pulses of blood to the newborn, boosting the iron and haemoglobin levels and thus preventing anemia. This is especially important in preterm babies, who have a higher risk of anemia. If you are interested, discuss this with your doctor or include it in your birth plan!",what,
What is a vaginal exam?,"Vaginal examinations (VEs) are conducted to assess a woman�s �progress� during labour. This is performed by a doctor or midwife who will wear a pair of sterile gloves, lubricate, and gently insert two fingers into the vagina. The cervix will be assessed to see how open (or known as dilated) it is, measuring from 1 to 10cm. Your baby's head will be checked to see how well it is sitting on the cervix, as well as the baby's position. During labour, you will be examined approximately every 4 hours. With this exam, is the possible for bacteria to be pushed up the vagina and toward the cervix, especially if the amniotic sac has released, as there is no longer a protection for your baby against potential infections. During the exam, the amniotic membrane can also be ruptured, and this can increase the risk of other complications such as prolapse of the umbilical cord. If you have more questions about the vaginal exam, talk with your doctor to find out more. ",what,
How can I reduce leg swelling?,"Avoid long periods of standing. Take occasional breaks and have a seat. - Elevate your legs as much as possible. When you are sitting, rest your feet up on another chair. When you are sleeping, prop your feet on pillows to raise them. - Keep the blood flowing in your legs with pregnancy-appropriate exercises such as walking or swimming. - Wear comfortable shoes that aren't too constricting, and consider getting insoles that provide support and help reduce leg and back pain. - Wear support hose that helps improve blood flow from your legs back, and put them on in the morning before swelling starts. - Stay hydrated, drink plenty of water to get rid of the excess salt or other waste products in your body, minimising swelling. ",how,
What is a mucus plug?,"During pregnancy, the mucus plug develops and lodges in the cervix to block the birth canal. It protects your womb from unwanted germs that enter, and contains antimicrobial components, thus killing bacteria that comes in its way! The mucus looks similar to that from your nose and throat (white/ off-white/ yellow and thick, sometimes pink streaked with blood), and the plug is about 4-5cm long. Closer to the end of your pregnancy, you may notice a thick vaginal discharge - this is the mucus plug falling out as the cervix opens and ""ripens"" in preparation for labour. Don't worry if you lose it earlier in pregnancy, your body will create more mucus to protect your baby!",what,
"What is lightening, dropping, and engaging?","As you approach your due date, your baby drops (or settles) in the mother's pelvis. This is known as 'dropping', 'lightening', 'descent' or 'engagement'. While dropping usually occurs a month before your due date (and is an indication that your body is preparing for delivery), it does not predict exactly when labour will start. After dropping occurs, you may notice that your breathing becomes easier, heartburn occurs less frequently, and you have a greater appetite as there is more space for your stomach. However, the increased pressure on your bladder after dropping occurs may make you have the urge to urinate more often.",what,
What is a nesting instinct?,"The nesting instinct is nature's way of preparing expecting mothers for their new baby. The adrenaline circulating can cause the mother to feel the urge to ready their nests prior to childbirth. To some, this involves cleaning the house, stocking up on baby supplies. Some may be even more dramatic or irrational about this, folding their babies clothes over and over again, and others might not experience this at all and prefer to just lie down and rest during the last few weeks of pregnancy. As long as you recognise your limitations and do not push yourself too hard, there is no problem with striving to prepare as much as possible before your little one arrives. ",what,
Why do I have blurring of vision during pregnancy?,"Blurring of vision commonly experienced during pregnancy. Your blurry vision is likely due to a side effect of pregnancy. The increased hormones decreases tear production, leading to eye dryness and irritation. They also cause fluid to build up in the eyes (similar to the edema in the hands and feet), causing the shape of your lens to change, leading to a change in vision. In the meantime, you may want to wear your glasses instead of contacts for comfort. Keep eye drops handy to help soothe drier eyes, and use them several times a day, not only when you feel your eyes are dry. Also, check your blood pressure and your blood sugar (if you have not done so previously), to make sure the blurry vision is not due to something more serious. If you notice dimming vision, spots, and floaters that don't go away, or double vision that persists for more than two hours, this may be a sign of something more serious. Please see your doctor right away. ",why,
How will the doctor track my baby's and my condition as I enter labour?,"During labour, two electric sensors will be placed on top of your tummy - one to measure  your contractions, and the other to measure your baby's heart rate. Each sensor is attached to a wire connected to the machine, and elastic belts hold the sensors in place. This method of monitoring is called continuous cardiotocography (CTG). The monitor produces a long piece of graph paper which you will see your doctor referring to. The two lines on the paper show the relationship of the pattern of your contractions and the pattern of your baby's heartbeat. This will tell the doctor how your baby is coping with labour. A normal pattern can reassure both you and your doctor that it is safe to continue labour if no other problems are present. If there is an abnormal pattern, your doctor will first try and find the cause and can help the baby by providing more oxygen or get you to change your position. If these do not work, or if the problem is more serious, you may need to deliver your baby right away, by an emergency c-section. ",how,
What is a membrane sweep?,"Membrane stripping (or sweeping) is one of the ways to induce labour. During your clinic visit, your doctor will use his or her finger to gently separate the amniotic sac (also known as the water bag) from the side of your womb near your cervix. This process releases hormones that can stimulate contractions and labour. As it is not the most effective method to induce labour, it is not routinely done. Membrane stripping is different from membrane rupture, as the sac is left intact. Stripping may be done once or repeated, depending on your progress. You may feel cramps and experience spotting over the next few days - do not be alarmed, this is normal. However, if you experience severe pain or bright red bleeding, see your doctor immediately.

What is a push present?,"A push present is a gift that the father gives to the mom to commemorate the birth of their baby. While the baby is the greatest gift in itself, a present to recognise the hard work and effort the mom has put in to carrying the baby for 9 months and delivering is a nice bonus. There are plenty of options for a push present that will not burst your budget. While any of these would be a sweet thought, simply being present is the best present of all. ",what,
Why do I get weird and vivid dreams during pregnancy?,"Three factors contribute to the wild, odd dreams that you may be having: 1) hormonal changes during pregnancy 2) interrupted REM (rapid eye movement) sleep pattern, especially since pregnant women tend to wake more often throughout the night to pee or as a result of being physically uncomfortable 3) pregnancy comes with waves of excitement and stress, and dreams are a reflection of your emotional and mental state - your thoughts, hopes, and fears about pregnancy and becoming a mom. If you find your dreams vivid but tolerable, they are likely your unconscious mind processing information. You could try to deduce possible sources - some women may find talking to their partner or a friend may help. If your dreams are due to inconsistent sleep, try new sleeping positions, and keep to a consistent sleep schedule. If your dreams or nightmares are more disturbing and worry you, try keeping a 'dream journal'. This can help you process the content of your dream by bringing them to your conscious mind. Some women may also find that talking to their partner or a friend to rationalise the dream may help. ",why,
Why is my blood pressure high during pregnancy?,"If you already had hypertension before pregnancy or during pregnancy (but less than 20 weeks), you have what is called 'chronic hypertension'. If you were already on an antihypertensive, ensure that it is a medication that is safe in pregnancy. Throughout your pregnancy, your blood pressure, urine, and weight will be monitored at your antenatal checkups. This is done to screen for pre-clampsia, which may have complications for you and your baby. If you are diagnosed with hypertension after 20 weeks in pregnancy, you have what is called 'gestational hypertension'. Most of the time, this resolves after delivery.",why,

What is an amniotomy?,"The experience of water breaking is different for every woman and every pregnancy. For some. It ranges from a slow, continuous leak to a strong gush. In other women, their water bag might not break at all! Your doctor may break your water bag for you to start or enhance labour � this is known as an amniotomy or artificial rupture of membranes (ARM). During an amniotomy, your doctor will insert a sterile thin plastic hook in the vagina to nick the amniotic sac, creating a hole. This will release the fluid, which contains a hormone (prostaglandin) that can help to improve your contractions, thus speeding up labour. However, this procedure can increase the risk of other complications such as prolapse of the umbilical cord, or a potential infection (as there is no longer a membrane to protect your baby). If you have more questions about the amniotomy, talk with your doctor to find out more and put your planned preference in your birth plan!",special,
Can I eat or drink during labour?,"Hospitals and doctors have different policies on eating and drinking during labour. Eating during labour provides you with extra nourishment and energy to push during delivery. If you do eat during labour, choose something light and easy on the stomach, that gives you an energy boost (such as toast or plain biscuits). If you are thirsty and can drink during labour, isotonic drinks are recommended to give you energy. However, some may not recommend eating or drinking during labour, especially if you are on pain relief medication (as these can slow down movement of food through your stomach), or if you may need a general anesthetic (for an emergency caesarean section). Don�t worry, if you are restricted on food and drinks during labour, you will still be able to suck on ice chips which will refresh you and cool you down during the tiring process of labour.",should,
How to I prepare for a c-section?,"Packing for the hospital birth can be a daunting task. Here are a list of categorised items on what to pack in your hospital bag! 1) Documents (your ID, hospital paperwork, insurance papers, and birth plan) 2) Clothes (bathrobe, nightgown, nursing bras, maternity underpants, sanitary pads, slippers and socks, a going home outfit for yourself) 3) Toiletries (hair and body wash, toothbrush, toothpaste, lip balm, lotion) 4) Electronics (cellphone and charger or powerbank) 5) For the baby (diapers, baby wipes, a going home outfit, car seat) 6) Miscellaneous (spectacles, hair ties, nursing pillow). Avoid bringing any jewellery or valuable possessions with you",how,
What is the C-section procedure?,"Before the c-section, your abdomen will be cleansed. A catheter will be placed in the bladder to collect urine, and an IV line will be placed to give fluids or medication. A scheduled (or elective) c-section is typically done under epidural anesthesia, which lowers the lower half of your body (meaning that you will be awake during the procedure). In an emergency c-section, general anesthesia will be given, meaning that you will be put to sleep and will wake up only after the delivery. The doctor will then make an incision over the abdomen (usually a horizonal bikini cut near the pubic region) and the womb and deliver the baby. Similar to a vaginal delivery, the umbilical cord will be clamped and cut, and the placenta will be removed from the womb. The incisions will then be closed with sutures, and you will be brought to the recovery room.",what,
What happens after the C-Section?,"After a c-section, most mothers and babies stay in the hospital for 2 to 3 days. During this time, you will be given painkillers as your anesthesia wears off. Within 24 hours of the delivery, your catheter and IV will be removed and you will also be encouraged to get up and walk as this helps to speed up your recovery. Due to the anesthesia, you may not have a strong appetite yet. Nonetheless, keep hydrated with plenty of fluids to replenish the blood loss during the delivery. You may also start breastfeeding as soon as you feel ready. ",what,
Do I need a routine IV for labour?,"In some hospitals, it may be routine for all women to have an IV (an intravenous line - a flexible line placed in the vein of your hand or arm), so that fluids and medication can be given. This is especially so for women having an epidural (who need to stay hydrated), or those at higher risk of having an emergency caesarean who may need to be given medication quickly. However, you do not need an IV just because you are in labour. In women choosing an unmedicated birth, an IV is not necessary. To help you stay hydrated and well nourished for the hard work of labour, eat and drink before you get to the hospital. Talk to your doctor about your planned preference and put them into your birth plan!",do,
How can I push effectively during labour?,"Pushing your baby is one of the most exciting (and tiring) parts of labour! There are two types of pushing: coached and spontaneous. In coached pushing, there will be someone (usually a nurse or midwife) to support labour by directing you to push, bearing down 2-3 times per contraction. In spontaneous pushing, you will push when you feel an urge to do so (usually accompanied by a contraction). While coached pushing was previously the convention, spontaneous pushing is now more often recommended. Push as if you are having a bowel movement, and focus on your baby, not your bowel! � Put your chin to your chest to direct your push. � Focus your energy on pushing; yelling, straining your face or other muscles could use up crucial energy that you need. � Rest and conserve your energy between your contractions so that you do not tire out. � Listen to the instructions given by the nurse, midwife, or doctor with you in the room. � Do not give up! You�re almost at the finish line!",how,
When in my pregnancy should I stop working?,"Deciding when to stop working before the baby arrives is a choice determined by a variety of factors.

In all cases, don't push yourself too much, listen to your body and your doctor. ",when,

If you are experiencing severe abdominal pain, bleeding down below, leaking of fluid from your water bag, or if your baby is not moving, seek medical consult immediately. Your doctor might recommend complete bed rest.",symptom,
Do I need an injection to deliver the placenta?,"The third stage of labour is when you deliver your placenta after the birth of your baby and the umbilical cord is clamped.

Talk to your doctor to find out more or put your planned preference into your birth plan.",do,
Can I shower during labour?,"Great question! If you are at home and there are no complications and the pregnancy has been normal and uneventful, you can stay at home and take a shower before heading to the hospital. Already in labour in the hospital? Talk with your doctor or nurse to see if a shower is available. Warm showers can ease pain and relax muscles during labour. However, if you are not advised to shower, there are other options for keeping clean, such as using body wipes, powder, or even a clean cloth dipped in warm water. Consider packing these in your hospital bag!",should,
How many people can be with me during labour and delivery? ,"Witnessing the miracle of childbirth can be a joyous and memorable occasion, and being invited to share in that experience should be considered a privilege. Some moms-to-be prefer to have only their partner with them during the delivery, while others are open to their family and friends being a part of the experience. Certain hospitals have official policies on how many people can be in the room when the mother delivers. Generally, children are not allowed inside (especially the young ones who aren't independent). Talk to your doctor about your planned preferences, and if you have decided who will be joining you in the delivery, it would also be good to establish where that person should be situated in the room as labour can be a busy situation, with nurses, midwives and doctors also moving around attending the delivery. ",how,
Can I videotape the delivery?,"Many parents want to capture their baby�s arrival in the world, be it through a photo or video. However, each hospital differs in its policy on photo and video recording and there is still no clear consensus on whether this should be banned in delivery rooms. Some encourage parents to record their child�s birth, some allow recording before and after, but not during the actual childbirth, and some do not allow this at all. Talk to your doctor to find out more about your hospital�s policy and if they do allow this, put your planned preference in your birth plan!",should,
What is an episiotomy?,"An episiotomy (also known as 'the cut') is a small diagonal cut made in the area between the vagina and anus to widen the vaginal opening. This is typically done to make delivery easier or prevent tearing of the vaginal tissue. While episiotomy was routinely performed in the past, nowadays it is only done if there is a need for it. Some reasons why your doctor or midwife might recommend an episiotomy are: - A large and potentially serious vaginal tear appears likely. - Your baby is large or is in an abnormal position. - Your baby is in distress and needs to be delivered quickly. Talk to your doctor about episiotomy during your labour and put your planned preference into your birth plan!",what,
What to do after episiotomy to heal faster?,"Congratulations on your newborn child! If you've had an episiotomy, you will have stitches down below that are (not surprisingly) painful. Depending on how severe the tear is, the pain may last longer.  Cool the wound with an ice pack immediately after birth and change the ice pack every few hours over the next 12 hours to reduce swelling and discomfort. - Practice good postpartum hygiene by 1) changing your sanitary pad every time you use the bathroom 2) wipe from front to back 3) use a squirt bottle to dilute your urine so that it reduces the stinging sensation from the urine coming in contact with the wound. - Take painkillers such as paracetamol or NSAIDs (do not take aspirin if you are breastfeeding). - Do Kegel exercises (clenching your pelvic muscles) to help your vagina feel firmer and prevent incontinence",what,
